# modern-language-graphs

During this past year (2019-2020), the school where I teach French has been considering making changes to the daily schedule and potentially adding staff. In order for the Modern Lanuage department (my department) to better make it's case for hiring additional language teaching staff, I made some graphs to highlight our needs. 

# Graph 1 - District Level 1
I made this graph using R and RStudio. This graph is meant to highlight how much seat time students recieve in "level 1" at the middle schools in different districts in the St. Louis region. The intention here was to make an arguement for increased seat time in our level 1 courses, which could be achieved through the addition of new staff members.

# Graph 2 - Preps
I made this graph using Python (Seaborn library). The purpose of this graph is to highlight the number of different "preps" (different classes that each teacher must prepare a lesson for each day) by department. As you can see from the graph, Modern Language teachers teach more different classes per day than any other department, suggesting a need for increased staffing to lighten the load on these teachers.
