# modern-language-graphs

During this past year (2019-2020), the school where I teach French has been considering making changes to the daily schedule and potentially adding staff. In order for the Modern Lanuage department (my department) to better make it's case for hiring additional language teaching staff, I made some graphs to highlight our needs. I made these graphs using R and RStudio.
